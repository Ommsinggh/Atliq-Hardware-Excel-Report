Atliq Hardware, a global company shipping products internationally, faced a significant challenge. With **67 customers spread across 23 different markets**
they struggled to monitor net sales performance effectively.
This lack of visibility made it difficult to identify which customers and markets were meeting targets and which were falling short.
